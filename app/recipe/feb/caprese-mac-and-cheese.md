## Ingredients

- 12 oz orecchiette pasta

- 1/4 cup unsalted butter

- 1/4 cup all purpose flour

- 3 cups whole milk

- 8 oz shredded Italian cheese blend

- 1 tbsp chopped fresh basil, plus small leaves for topping

- 2 tsp dijon mustard

- 2 tsp kosher salt

- 2 small heirloom tomatoes, cut into 1/4-in.-thick slices

- 1/2 cup mozzarella pearls

# Instructions

1. Cook pasta according to package directions. Drain and set aside.

2. While pasta cooks, melt butter in a large saucepan over medium. Add flour; cook, whisking constantly, until mixture is light brown and smells toasty, about 2 minutes. Slowly whisk in milk; cook, stirring often, until thickened, about 8 minutes. Remove from heat. Let cool slightly, stirring occasionally, for 3 minutes. Add cheese blend; stir until melted. Stir in chopped basil, mustard, and salt until well combined. Fold in drained pasta.

3. Preheat broiler with oven rack in center position. Transfer pasta to a broiler-safe 2 1/2-quart baking dish. Arrange tomato slices and mozzarella over pasta.

4. Broil until tomatoes are softened, mozzarella is melted, and surface is beginning to brown in spots, 5 to 8 minutes. Top with basil leaves.
